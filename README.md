## 🎯 Medical Specialties Configured
1. Internal Medicine
2. Obesity Medicine
3. Registered Dietitian
4. Cardiology
5. Emergency Medicine
6. Surgery
7. Psychiatry
8. Pediatrics

## 🔧 Configuration Required
To fully enable the app, configure these in Settings:
1. **Azure Speech Service Key** - For voice recording
2. **Azure Speech Region** - Usually 'eastus'
3. **Azure OpenAI Endpoint** - Your OpenAI resource URL
4. **Azure OpenAI API Key** - Your OpenAI key
5. **OpenAI Deployment Name** - Usually 'gpt-4'

## ⚠️ Important Notes & Rules
1. **NEVER** edit the Static Web App workflow file (fragile Azure token)
2. **Path filters active** - Frontend/backend deploy separately
3. **Logo file** - Must be named `aayu-logo.png` in `src/assets/`
4. **Session timeout** - Users auto-logout after 1 hour of inactivity
5. **Recording limit** - Can record continuously up to 1 hour
6. **Baseline notes** - Maximum 5 notes stored for AI training

## 🐛 Recently Fixed Bugs
1. ✅ Microphone access stopping after 1 second → Fixed with extended timeouts
2. ✅ App.css had JavaScript code → Replaced with proper CSS
3. ✅ Training/Settings/Users pages blank → Added complete render functions
4. ✅ Add Patient button not working → Fixed modal and form handling
5. ✅ Logo not showing → Added fallback SVG for missing logo
6. ✅ Session not timing out → Implemented proper activity tracking
7. ✅ Memory leaks in speech recognizer → Added comprehensive cleanup
8. ✅ LocalStorage corruption → Added validation and error handling

## 📊 Current Data Storage
- **Patients:** `localStorage` key `medicalScribePatients`
- **Visits:** `localStorage` key `visits_{patientId}`
- **Training:** `localStorage` key `medicalScribeTraining`
- **API Settings:** `localStorage` key `medicalScribeApiSettings`
- **Session:** `localStorage` keys `currentUser` and `lastActivity`

## 🚦 Next Priorities
1. **Connect Azure Table Storage** - Replace localStorage for production
2. **Real User Creation** - Connect to backend API for user management
3. **Export Functionality** - Add ability to export notes as PDF/Word
4. **Backup System** - Automated backups of patient data
5. **Multi-provider Support** - Allow multiple providers to share patients
6. **Mobile Responsive** - Optimize for tablet/phone use
7. **Offline Mode** - Cache data for offline access
8. **Print Functionality** - Direct printing of visit notes

## 🎨 Design System
- **Primary Green:** #bae637
- **Primary Navy:** #27266b
- **Accent Purple:** #9b2fcd
- **Glass Effects:** backdrop-filter with blur(12px)
- **Border Radius:** 8px (small), 12px (medium), 20px (large)
- **Font:** SF Pro Display / Segoe UI

## 🔒 Security Features
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Session timeout after 1 hour
- Activity monitoring
- Secure credential storage (local only)
- HIPAA compliance ready (needs Azure connection)

## 📝 Known Limitations
1. **Data Persistence** - Currently using localStorage (not permanent)
2. **User Creation** - Demo mode only (not persisted)
3. **Multi-tab** - Session not synced across browser tabs
4. **API Keys** - Stored in browser (move to backend for production)
5. **File Upload** - Not implemented yet
6. **Dictation Languages** - English only currently

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If microphone stops working:
1. Check browser permissions
2. Verify Azure Speech key is correct
3. Check region matches your Azure resource
4. Try refreshing the page

### If AI notes generation fails:
1. Verify OpenAI endpoint URL format
2. Check API key is valid
3. Ensure deployment name is correct
4. Check you have transcript before generating

### If login fails:
1. Use exact credentials (case-sensitive)
2. Clear browser cache/localStorage
3. Try incognito mode
