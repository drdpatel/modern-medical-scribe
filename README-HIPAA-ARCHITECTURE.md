# HIPAA-Compliant Architecture Plan

## Current Setup (Working)
- **Frontend:** Azure Static Web App (blue-stone-0e6da7910)
- **API:** Azure Function App (aayuscribe-api)
- **Database:** Azure Tables (needs upgrade)
- **Status:** Working but needs HIPAA compliance

## Required for HIPAA Compliance

### Phase 1: Fix Deployment (TODAY)
- [x] Separate Frontend and API properly
- [x] Fix deployment pipeline
- [ ] Ensure no PHI in frontend

### Phase 2: Authentication (WEEK 1)
- [ ] Azure AD B2C integration
- [ ] Remove hardcoded passwords
- [ ] Add MFA
- [ ] Session management

### Phase 3: Database (WEEK 2)
- [ ] Migrate to Cosmos DB or Azure SQL
- [ ] Enable encryption at rest
- [ ] Set up automated backups
- [ ] Enable audit logs

### Phase 4: Security (WEEK 3)
- [ ] Azure Key Vault for secrets
- [ ] Application Insights for audit trail
- [ ] API rate limiting
- [ ] Sign BAA with Microsoft

## Cost Estimate
- Current: ~$25/month (not HIPAA compliant)
- Target: ~$100-150/month (HIPAA compliant)
- HIPAA violation fine: $50,000-$2,000,000
